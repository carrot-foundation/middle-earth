# Carrot Foundation AI Rules

These rules are located in `.ai/` folder. Always read the actual rule files when working on tasks.

## Quick Reference

- Code Quality: `.ai/categories/code-quality/`
- Workflow: `.ai/categories/workflow/`
- Documentation: `.ai/categories/documentation/`

## Usage

When working on a task:
1. Check `manifest.json` for relevant rules
2. Read the specific rule file based on task type
3. Apply rules based on priority (required > recommended > optional)

## Rule Discovery

Start by reading `.ai/manifest.json` to discover all available rules. The manifest provides:
- Complete list of all rules organized by category
- File paths for each rule
- Metadata (priority, appliesTo, tools, version)
- Related rules for context

## Filtering Rules

Use the `appliesTo` field to determine which rules are relevant:
- `["typescript", "javascript"]` - Only apply when working with TypeScript/JavaScript
- `["all"]` - Always apply (e.g., commit messages, PRs)
- `["markdown"]` - Only apply when working with markdown files

## Priority Levels

- **required**: Always apply these rules when context matches
- **recommended**: Apply as best practices, but allow flexibility
- **optional**: Reference when relevant, but not mandatory

## Common Workflows

### Writing TypeScript Code
1. Read `.ai/categories/code-quality/code-style.md`
2. Read `.ai/categories/code-quality/typescript.md`
3. Read `.ai/categories/code-quality/code-comments.md` (recommended)

### Creating a Pull Request
1. Read `.ai/categories/workflow/pull-request.md`
2. Read `.ai/categories/workflow/commit.md` (for commit history context)
3. Read `.ai/categories/workflow/branch-naming.md` (to verify branch name)

### Writing Documentation
1. Read `.ai/categories/documentation/markdown.md`

## Important Notes

- **Always read the full rule file**, not just summaries in `instructions.md`
- **Check relatedRules** in frontmatter for complete context
- **Project Extensions** - Check for project-specific extensions in this same directory (`.cursor/rules/*-project.mdc`)
- **Rules are generic** - These are organizational standards, project-specific extensions belong in project repos (outside `.ai/` folder)
